## Workout Templates

In order to use a workout template when creating a workout you must first create a template.  
Template creation is performed in the same way a regular workout is created with the exception of assigning an account.
* Upon completion of a template navigate to the `Add Workout` page.
* Choose an account
* Choose a template
* Finally Name the workout and click Save

Upon Saving your workout you will be taken to the workout overview screen, and your new workout will have been added for the selected account.
If you need anything to be different from the template version select the workout and edit it to match the client's needs.


In order to store data for each week separately, we do need to add each week individually. Otherwise there would be no way to change the reps, sets by week.
